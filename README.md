 ## Car E-Commerce Project  Welcome to the Car E-Commerce project! This e-commerce platform allows users to showcase and advertise cars. It's approximately 90% ready for use, providing a valuable resource for learning or direct utilization.  ### Getting Started  1. **Fork the Project:**    - Fork this repository and install dependencies using `npm install`.  2. **Configuration:**    - Rename `.exampleenv` to `.env` and input your MongoDB URI, Stripe secret key, and public key for the backend.  3. **Run the Backend:**    - Install `nodemon` globally (`npm install -g nodemon`) and start the backend using `nodemon serve` or `node serve` in the project directory.  4. **Edit Car Data:**    - Modify the JSON files holding car makes, models, and locations in the `data` directory. Add more car details or customize locations based on your preferences.  5. **Configure Payment:**    - In the frontend, navigate to the `checkout` component and add your Paystack key in the public key (line 13). For live environments, ensure to use environmental variables.  6. **Configure Image Upload:**    - In `Newcar.js` (inside the `page` folder), add your Cloudinary name and upload preset key.  7. **Customize Edit Car Page:**    - The Edit Car page is open for your development. Feel free to enhance it or reach out for guidance.  8. **Admin Route:**    - The `/admin` route allows user suspension, but the patch route isn't defined in the backend. Contact me for assistance.  9. **Implement Bidding:**    - You can add a bidding backend route; the frontend position is already available. Customize the implementation or seek guidance.  10. **Socket.io Implementation:**     - Implement alerts using Socket.io when a user places an order. The backend has the foundation; complete it or reach out for support.  Feel free to fork and use this project! If you have any questions or need assistance, don't hesitate to contact me. Happy coding! ðŸš—ðŸ’»
